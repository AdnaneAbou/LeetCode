# 🚀 Grinding Journey


Welcome to my **LeetCode Grinding Journey**! In this repository, I am sharing my progress as I tackle **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** challenges on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) using **Python** and **C++**. My goal is to build a solid foundation in problem-solving while sharing my journey to inspire and help others starting from scratch.  

This repo isn't just about solutions—it's about growth, learning, and consistency. Whether you're a beginner trying to go from **0 to 1** or someone looking for different perspectives on solving problems, I hope this will be a helpful resource!  


## 🤔 My Approach: Dumb Solutions First (Brute Force)!

At the start, I focus on **writing simple (even dumb) solutions (Brute Force)** without worrying too much about time complexity or optimization. The idea is to build a habit of solving problems consistently rather than getting stuck trying to find the "perfect" solution right away. Once the problem is solved, I gradually refactor and optimize the code, learning from mistakes and inefficiencies along the way.

After being a bit familiarized with the concept , you can delve into learning some Patterns summurized as follows : 
    1. Two Pointers 
    2. Prefix Sum
    3. Sliding Window 
    4. Binary Search 
    5. FAST & Slow pointers
    6. Linked-List In-place Reversal
    7. Monotonic stack
    8. Top K elements
    9. Quicke Select
    10. Bucket Sort
    11. Interval Overlapping
    12. Binary Tree Traversal
    13. BFS & DFS
    14. Backtracking
    15. Dynamic Programming 

### 💡 Tip for Readers:
> **Avoid using AI tools (like LLMs) to solve problems for you.**  instead use it to criticize your code or so ..
> Solving even **10 problems with your brain** is far more valuable than solving 100 problems by relying on AI. This is your training ground to develop problem-solving skills, and the best way to grow is by challenging your mind to think critically and work through the logic yourself. It is totally okay if a problem took some time and it will ,You will be rewarded after on!
