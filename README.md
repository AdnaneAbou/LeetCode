# 🚀 Grinding Journey


Welcome to my **LeetCode Grinding Journey**! In this repository, I am sharing my progress as I tackle **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** challenges on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) using **Python** and **C++**. My goal is to build a solid foundation in problem-solving while sharing my journey to inspire and help others starting from scratch.  

This repo isn't just about solutions—it's about growth, learning, and consistency. Whether you're a beginner trying to go from **0 to 1** or someone looking for different perspectives on solving problems, I hope this will be a helpful resource!  


## 🤔 My Approach: Dumb Solutions First!

At the start, I focus on **writing simple (even dumb) solutions** without worrying too much about time complexity or optimization. The idea is to build a habit of solving problems consistently rather than getting stuck trying to find the "perfect" solution right away. Once the problem is solved, I gradually refactor and optimize the code, learning from mistakes and inefficiencies along the way.

### 💡 Tip for Readers:
> **Avoid using AI tools (like LLMs) to solve problems for you.**  
> Solving even **10 problems with your brain** is far more valuable than solving 100 problems by relying on AI. This is your training ground to develop problem-solving skills, and the best way to grow is by challenging your mind to think critically and work through the logic yourself. It is totally okay if a problem took some time and it will ,You will be rewarded after on!

## 🔥 My Motivation
Starting LeetCode can feel overwhelming. The goal of this repo is to make it approachable for beginners and inspire others to stay consistent. Remember, it's not about how fast you solve problems but how much you learn in the process.
